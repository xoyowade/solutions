Sudoku
=========

Hacking the Sudoku example in Chapter 1:

1. support different sizes of Sudoku problems other than 9-by-9  

2. use symbols instead of integers to represent puzzle

3. optimization: init const arrays at the beginning to avoid unnecessary obj alloc

The (2) idea and the test case of 25-by-25 size is taken from [Hacking the Sudoku solver from The Ruby Programming Language](http://djconnel.blogspot.com/2012/07/hacking-sudoku-solver-from-ruby.html).
